# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Simply put, the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. 

<br/>

In other words, what we want is to have the objects of our subclasses behaving the same way as the objects of our superclass.

## Let us go by an example:

<br/>

By looking at the above scenario you might still argue that it looks pretty consistent. That is true for the language you are coding in and also for Mathematics but a Square might not always satisfy the behavior of a Rectangle.

This is what I mean:
